// Palindrome Checker
// Return true if the given string is a palindrome. Otherwise, return false.

// A palindrome is a word or sentence that's spelled the same way both forward and backward, ignoring punctuation, case, and spacing.

// Note: You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for palindromes.

// We'll pass strings with varying formats, such as "racecar", "RaceCar", and "race CAR" among others.

// We'll also pass strings with special symbols, such as "2A3*3a2", "2A3 3a2", and "2_A3*3#A2".

// Submit a pull request to the main branch with your solution. Do not modify the tests. Once you have created a PR with passing tests, then you have successfully completed the exercise.


//Pseudocode
//step1:Change string to lowercase or uppercase 
//step2:Remove non-alphanumeric character 
//step3:Reverse our string
//step4:Remove non-alphanumeric from string,converting to lowercase and make it a word. 
//step5:Comparing our string to the reversed one


function palindrome (str) {
  // write your code here
    let reversedString = str.toLowerCase().match(/[a-z0-9]/g).reverse().join("");
  let string = str.toLowerCase().match(/[a-z0-9]/g).join("")
    if(reversedString==string){
     return true;
   }
  else{
    return false;
  }
}
