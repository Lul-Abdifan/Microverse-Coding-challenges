// A word is an anagram of another word if both use the same letters in the same quantity, but arranged differently.

// For example:
// friend and Finder are anagrams.
// The Morse Code and Here come dots are anagrams as well.
// Note: You'll need to remove all non-alphanumeric characters (punctuation, spaces and symbols) and turn everything into the same case (lower or upper case) in order to check for anagram.

// Submit a pull request to the main branch with your solution. Do not modify the tests. Once you have created a PR with passing tests, then you have successfully completed the exercise.


  // write your code here
  // put the charaters together without spaces
  //Pseudocode:
//1)step1:Change to one casing
//2)step2:Removing non-alphanumeric character
//3)step3)Sorting in ascending order
//4)step4)Comparing each other
